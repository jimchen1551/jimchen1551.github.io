      abstract = {Visual field (VF) testing is the gold standard for glaucoma detection as it measures optic nerve function; however, color fundus photography (CFP) is easier to obtain and more feasible for screening purposes. The purpose of this study was to develop AI models that can use CFP as inputs to generate VF test results. This retrospective cross-sectional study included 14,959 CFP–VF pairs from 8,532 eyes of 4,486 patients seen at Tri-Service General Hospital, Taiwan (2018–2023). Reliable Humphrey 24-2 SITA VFs and macular-centered, 45° CFPs from the same eye and date were included. The dataset was split at the patient level into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) sets. A model using pre-trained RETFound as a frozen encoder paired with a transformer-based regression head was compared to a baseline model using a ResNet-based encoder followed by a fully connected regression head for the generation of VF sensitivities from the input CFPs. Performance metrics included  mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of mean sensitivity (MS), coefficient of determination (R²), and pointwise MAE maps (PW-MAE). Patients were aged 55.3 ± 15.5 years, and the average global mean deviation value was -6.82±8.20. The RETFound model outperformed the ResNet baseline for MS estimation (MAE 2.82 vs. 3.82 dB; RMSE 4.38 vs. 5.56 dB; R² 0.70 vs. 0.51;). Pointwise MAE heatmaps showed lower error across the field compared with the baseline. Bland-Altman plots for both MS and MD showed improved agreement and narrower limits of agreement for RETFound relative to MLEDL, indicating more reliable global functional estimation from CFPs (Figure). A RETFound-based model with a transformer regression head substantially improves same-day VF estimation from macular-centered CFPs compared with an ResNet baseline. The combination of lower error, stronger correlation, and better agreement in MS and MD suggests that foundation model–based structure–function mapping may provide clinically meaningful VF surrogates in settings where perimetry is unavailable, unreliable, or infeasible.},

abstract = {Personalized medication recommendations aim to suggest a set of medications based on the clinical conditions of a patient. Not only should the patient’s diagnosis, procedure, and medication history be considered, but drug-drug interactions (DDIs) must also be taken into account to prevent adverse drug reactions. Although recent studies on medication recommendation have considered DDIs and patient history, personalized disease progression and prescription have not been explicitly modeled. In this work, we proposed FastRx, a Fastformer-based medication recommendation model to capture longitudinality in patient history, in combination with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to handle DDIs and co-prescribed medications in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Our extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrated superior performance of the proposed FastRx over existing state-of-the-art models for medication recommendation. },

abstract = {Introduction: White-coat hypertension (WCH) and masked hypertension (MH) complicate accurate blood pressure (BP) monitoring. While ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) is effective, its high cost and limited availability are significant barriers. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that a machine learning (ML) model using clinical data from a single outpatient visit could accurately predict WCH and MH. Aims: This study aimed to develop and validate ML-based prediction models for WCH and MH using accessible clinical data to improve diagnostic efficiency and accessibility. Methods: We enrolled patients from two hypertension cohorts, after excluding those with incomplete data. Patients were classified by office BP and ABPM readings per American Heart Association guidelines. ML models, including Multi-layer Perceptron （MLP）, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Tabular Prior-Data Fitted Network (Tab-PFN), were developed. Input parameters included demographic data (age, gender, height, weight, smoker), and office BP (OBP) and heart rate measurements. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), kernel PCA (kPCA), or t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) were used to improve class separability. Results: The study population comprised 1481 participants with a mean age of 47.6 years (SD 13.6), 65\% of whom were male and 20.1\% were smokers. OBP measurements showed a mean systolic BP (SBP) of 128.7 mmHg (SD 15.4) and a mean diastolic BP (DBP) of 84.2 mmHg (SD 11.6). ABPM showed a mean 24-hour systolic BP of 122.5 mmHg (SD 11.8) and diastolic BP of 79.3 mmHg (SD 10.1). The inclusion of demographic and OBP data, along with advanced resampling and dimensionality reduction techniques, significantly improved the model’s predictive ability. The final TabPFN model achieved the best performance with recall, precision, F1 score, and accuracy of 0.747, 0.931, 0.829, and 0.807 for WCH, and 0.713, 0.954, 0.816, and 0.907 for MH. Conclusion: Our ML-based model effectively predicts WCH and MH using accessible clinical data, offering a cost-effective alternative before applying ABPM.}
